                </div>
                <div class="page2-right">
                    <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines the digital divide as the “gap between individuals, households, businesses, and geographic areas at different socio-economic levels about both their opportunities to access information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to their use of the Internet for a wide variety of activities.” </p>

                    <h2>Causes of the Digital Divide</h2>
                        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Investing in education is crucial to bridging the digital divide. People with low literacy levels are at a disadvantage in the digital world. Those with college degrees are ten times more likely to fully utilize the internet and computers in their daily lives compared to those with only a high school education or less.</p>

                        <p><strong>Income Levels:</strong> Income disparities also worsen the digital divide. High-income individuals (earning $75,000 or more) are twenty times more likely to have internet access than low-income individuals (earning $30,000 or less). Wealthy families are ten times more likely to own computers and have high-speed internet at home compared to low-income families, who often see technology as a luxury due to their limited finances.</p>

                        <p><strong>Geographical Restrictions:</strong> More economically developed countries have better access to technology and high-speed broadband due to their wealth, while less economically developed countries lack the necessary technology and infrastructure for high-speed internet. Within a country, urban areas typically have better internet access, such as 4G or fiber optic, compared to rural or mountainous regions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Motivation and General Interest:</strong> Some individuals have the means, education, and computer literacy but lack interest in learning about computers and the internet. For some, technology is seen as a luxury, while others find it too complex to understand.</p>

                        <p><strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Developed nations have broader access to computers and high-speed internet, giving students attending schools with adequate technology an advantage over those without such exposure. In developing countries, the lack of physical access to technology widens the gap between those with access to information and those without.</p>

                    <h2>Effects or Impact of the Digital Divide</h2>
                        <p><strong>Impact of Digital Divide on Economy:</strong> Access to telecommunication services is a driving force behind economic growth. A nation's economic productivity is significantly boosted by widespread internet usage. The ability to shop online reduces the hassle of commuting, and digital transactions provide a convenient way to empower economic activities. Unfortunately, developing countries that lack adequate integration of information and communication technology (ICT) experience a widening economic gap.</p>

                        <p><strong>Impact of Digital Divide on Education:</strong> The internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, offering numerous educational platforms for acquiring advanced skills. Access to ICT has been linked to academic success and the facilitation of exceptional scientific research. Education is a powerful tool for empowering individuals and society, and staying abreast of advancements in this dynamic sector is crucial for success</p>

                        <p><strong>Impact of the Digital Divide on Social Interactions:</strong>Internet access fuels communication, with social media platforms like Facebook promoting engagement, relationship building, and connection with friends and family. Access to information becomes faster, reducing reliance on traditional newspapers. The technological revolution has dramatically transformed art and music, enriching societies that have embraced these changes. Bridging the digital divide is crucial for empowering developing countries to benefit from these advancements.</p>

Bridging the digital divide is crucial for empowering developing countries to benefit from these advancements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Digital Divide in Education:</strong>According to Education Superhighway, 17.6 million students require minimum bandwidth to support digital learning. The FCC E-rate program is assisting schools in obtaining affordable broadband connections, ensuring they are connected to the web. However, schools in rural areas face challenges due to the absence of pre-existing infrastructure, resulting from low returns on investment and the difficulty of installing fiber optic cables.</p>

                        <p><strong>Teachers Lacking Technology-Based Skills:</strong> Simply having adequate technology and high-speed broadband access is insufficient to bridge the digital divide in education. Many teachers lack the training needed to effectively use these devices for facilitating digital learning. For meaningful, relevant, and focused learning, investing in the professional development and training of teachers is necessary.</p>

                      <strong>Exhibit 1:</strong> Rural Internet users in India are today almost exclusively male (98%), a different pattern from that of cities, where men dominate (79%) but women are also online in growing numbers (21%). More than 60% of rural users have been online for less than two years, which means most rural users are still relatively immature digitally, and their usage patterns can be expected to evolve as they gain experience. <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2016/globalization-customer-insight-rising-connected-consumer-in-rural-india">Know More.</a>.

                        <p>Globalization is the term used to refer to the integration of goods, services, and culture among the nations of the world. Globalization is not necessarily a new phenomenon; in many ways, we have been experiencing globalization since the days of European colonization. Further advances in telecommunication and transportation technologies accelerated globalization. The advent of the the worldwide Internet has made all nations next-door neighbors.</p>

                        <p><strong>The chart above shows how Internet speeds compare in different countries:</strong>As the Internet continues to make inroads across the world, it is also creating a separation between those who have access to this global network and those who do not. This separation is of great concern.The digital divide can occur between countries, regions, or even neighborhoods.</p>

                        <p><strong>The New Globalisation: </strong>Information technology has driven change on a global scale. Technology has given us the ability to integrate with people all over the world using digital tools. These tools have allowed businesses to broaden their labor pools, their markets, and even their operating hours. But they have also brought many new complications for businesses, which now must understand regulations, preferences, and cultures from many different nations. This new globalization has also exacerbated the digital divide. </p>
